what to graph:
    income at various retirement ages (years of service)
    income at various contribution levels (and increase factors/rates of growth)



assumptions to check/test:
    It seems like combined service across categories is used for the age-reduction-factor,
    so if you work only 10 years protective, and 15 years teacher, when looking up the 
    age-reduction factor you use 25 years of service for both look ups. confirmed with 
    WRS calculator, couldn't find clear documentation

additional options to implement:
accelerated payments
joint/survivor payments
increase rate of additional contribution (percentage and flat)


guaranteed payments
variable-fund adjustment
money-market comparison

for additional contributions:
start date, stop date (actual or projected)
retirementDate
